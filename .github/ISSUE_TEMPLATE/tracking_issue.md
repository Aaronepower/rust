<!--
Thank you for creating a tracking issue! ðŸ“œ Tracking issues are for tracking a
feature from implementation to stabilisation. Make sure to include the relevant
RFC for the feature if it has one. Otherwise provide a short summary of the
feature and link any relevant PRs or issues, and remove any sections that are
not relevant to the feature.
-->

This is a tracking issue for the RFC "XXX" (rust-lang/rfcs#NNN).

### Steps
<!--
Include each step required to complete the feature. Typically this is a PR
implementing a feature, followed by a PR that stabilises the feature. However
for larger features an implementation could be broken up into multiple PRs.
-->

- [ ] Implement the RFC (cc @rust-lang/XXX -- can anyone write up mentoring
      instructions?)
- [ ] Adjust documentation ([see instructions on rustc-guide][doc-guide])
- [ ] Stabilization PR ([see instructions on rustc-guide][stabilization-guide])

[stabilization-guide]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rustc-guide/stabilization_guide.html#stabilization-pr
[doc-guide]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rustc-guide/stabilization_guide.html#documentation-prs

### Unresolved Questions
<!--
Include any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be
stabilised.
-->

XXX --- list all the "unresolved questions" found in the RFC to ensure they are
not forgotten
